# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze customer review dataset from Amazon. Using [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/), the ETL process is performed to extract the dataset, transform the data, and connect to an [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) instance. The transformed data is then loaded into pgAdmin. Finally, Pandas is used to determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from paid "Amazon Vine" members in the dataset.

# Data Source
The dataset is extracted from [Amazon's US Reviews Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt). From this list, the Video Game dataset is chosen for analysis.
