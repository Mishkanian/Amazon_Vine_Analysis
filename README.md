# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze customer review dataset from Amazon. Using [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/), the ETL process is performed to extract the dataset, transform the data, and connect to an [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) instance. The transformed data is then loaded into pgAdmin. Finally, Pandas is used to determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from "[Amazon Vine](https://www.amazon.com/gp/vine/help)" members in the dataset.

## Data Source
The dataset is extracted from [Amazon's US Reviews Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt). From this list, the Video Game dataset is chosen for analysis.

## What is Amazon Vine?
Amazon Vine is a program launched by Amazon.com that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products from Amazon customers, called "Vine Voices." These Vine Voices are chosen based on their total number of reviews and helpfulness of reviews. **In exchange for free products, these Vine Voices are required to publish a review.** [Amazon's Vine help guide](https://www.amazon.com/gp/vine/help) states that "Voices are not paid" and that they "welcome honest opinion about the product."
